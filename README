FaultTolerantTheories is a junit theories runner. 
It differs from the provided Theories runner in that way that it doesn't stop running next test scenarios (data points) after the first failure 
and prints theory execution summary only after all scenarios are run.
Run StandardTheoriesBehaviorDemo and FaultTolerantTheoriesBehaviorDemo to compare two approaches.
